# edtechjoker
Project EdTechJoker resources / materials. This course is being built by the students taking it based on our pacing and how each week / project progresses. It is therefore a work in progress. The draft-outline will continue to be modified as we go based on how things are going or topics I feel we need to spend more time on.

This is Guided discovery pedagogy, where you are leading the course through rate of comprehension and completion. We start with some labs and getting tooling installed and then quickly move up through various projects that are critique driven.

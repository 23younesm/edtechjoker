              /* Overall take aways from entire class:
                - Some had a lot going on demos to show fleibility, love it
                - If using an image or sound effect make sure to set a value to this:
                  new URL("path-to-file",import.meta.url).href;
                - Several people got additional extra +.25 for going above and beyond requirements
                  at times or teaching me something via the way they constructed their button and
                  lots of you attempted and successfully implemented Sound as well as IntersectionObserver
                  mixin that my team wrote so great job.
                - Below are emojis for those with exceptional things to pay attention to though there is
                  something to be learned from all projects so this is completely open critique

              // button (hey, it's a Staples button I mean..), it definitely has a lot of technical superiority

              // and the demo to show-off all the different possibilities, with many states beyond what was required
              // is great. Keep up the great work!

# Project 3: HAX The Web
We arrive at the activist goal of the course.. well... my goals anyway - To generate the next generation of potential contributors to HAX the web and the hope of shaping the future of content creation on the web. While our goals are lofty, never set bars so low you can step over them lest you grow complacent and old.

# Scope
Contribute to HAX The Web through a series of open ended issues and project requirements. While many of these issues will have overlap in scope (create a web component / series of web components) not all groups will get the same element. This is attempting to generate something generally to specification and generally looking and functioning the same way as a prototype.

# Background
HAXTheWeb.org is a moon shot by me and my team to change publishing and make the web a place that all people can be creative without needing to learn complex web or CMS technologies. Our "lego" approach is entirely built on web components to encompass everything from a small icon all the way up to a full CMS as a single web component (made up of 100s of others).

# What you'll do
- Working as a group, you'll select from a series of pre-approved issues in the HAXTheWeb issue queue. These issues are intended to be a reasonable 6 week scope of a project while still being challenging
- All of the web components we'll work on are a mix of visual and "stateful" components; meaning that the web component must have knowledge of the "state" of itself
  - *If you like this project and are enrolled in my class next semester, this is the front-end piece that we'll wire to a backend in that course to make it a real micro-app*
- Produce and distribute a project on NPM that is well documented, has tests, has as storybook, is well designed, is reusable, maintains statefulness, is flexible design wise via CSS and JS events, and has built in wiring for HAXTheWeb to empower others

## Final / top prize(s)
Any elements that are of exceptional quality (or only needing minor tweaks for adoption) and get accepted into the HAXTheWeb portfolio of elements will get a üèí emoji implying that you get an official HAXTheWeb hockey jersey



# More to be announced as we get closer..


# Issues to choose from
There will only be a maximum of 2 groups per element allowed. This gives you a group that you can bounce ideas off of directly as to how you're going to do the build out while still ensuring variety in what is produced. You do not have to choose a project another group is doing and I will help with picking something I think your group can handle.

# Timeline

# Possible team break down

# Due Dates
There will be multiple check-ins for this that involve presenting your work in class via short stand up meeting style share outs. Class time will also largely be used for working and me going over certain concepts that most elements share in common (for example: input data and custom event management)

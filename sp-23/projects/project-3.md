# Project 3 (30%) - Contributing to the open source fabric of the university (and beyond)

For this project, you'll be selecting a real issue from our project's issue queue of a pre-selected, well-scoped, able to be completed in the last month of the semester level project.

## For Context
- I've closed [888 issues in the last 3 years](https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues?q=assignee%3Abtopro+is%3Aopen)
- The work preceeding this had several thousand that I had closed and millions of lines of code written for it
- If I make things seem easy at times, it is this grind. I am you in 15 years if you keep at it, nothing more.
- You will be grinding on a singular issue which is a real world problem / need we have
- If you find this work satisfying (broadly), get an A in this class and want to do more work like it in the future, I offer independent studies (3 credits, 10 hours a week work expectation, work on bigger problems / ideas)

## Project 3 high level requirements
- You are to select 1 of these projects to work on -- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- There are individual requirements for each project and general high level requirements listed on this prage.
- If there are unknowns, details should be teased out on discord or in the issue queue for this issue
- **This is an individual assignment. There are 5 projects, 53 in the class, that's ~10 solutions per project** 
- We will get into larger groups to swap ideas and come up with the problems / requirements for each project
- There will be a limit of 12 per project (or 6 pairs if you both want to work on it, though the work is individual)

## Requirements regardless of project selection
- [ ] Blog about the problem space and progress made each week as check ins. Small form writing, 3 paragraphs at most, with screen shots / code samples. Each project has specific checklist requirements so 
- [ ] published to npm / vercel as a stand alone demo but shown on an example page made

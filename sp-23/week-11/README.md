- have them fork it for contribution or work in branches on the same repo (your choice but have to work in 1 repo)
- clone locally (both of you)
- Come up with an intial API for working with your card/collapse
- start dividing labor. one person work on the API connector (badge-list), render results from the "search" endpoint

**Remember, the point of Project 2 is to generate the exact asset from the comp**

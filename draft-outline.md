# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

## Week 10: Micro frontends (project 2)

# Guest lecturer
EdTechJoker

### Overview
- Vercel and project publishing and communication
- Creating an API endpoint to return data
- Creating a basic web component to render data from an end point using fetch to obtain information

## Tues
- Discussing project two and the notion of micro front ends to get there
- [Project 2](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/sp-23/projects/project-2.md)
- Playing with and deploying example from a previous IST class

## Activity to get some base concepts
- EVERYONE. Make a new repo off of https://github.com/btopro/ist-vercel-demo
- Deploy to vercel
- While that's happening, git clone it to your computer
- run `npm install` then `npm start` then open another terminal and run `vercel dev`
- Some parts won't work, some will (That's fine, it's to have a copy for the time being). it's more important to have something to trace and see the flow of information

## In between class
- Keeping up with industry arguments: https://eisenbergeffect.medium.com/about-web-components-7b2a3ed67a78
- Why people keep writing long artitcles like this is bc of statements like this are rampant https://twitter.com/dannymoerkerke/status/1635387397105139713
- Watch this video to understand what's going on here but with a different example from scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgZKpJhQ7os
- We are building the front end to be more robust than this example but the same concepts apply
  - Front end asks for data or user has input
  - `fetch` hits vercel `/api` and processes information
  - response sent back and front end does something with it

## Thurs
## Follow along demo
- https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project - IP Project (ignore odd name) is a demonstration of loading JSON data and running a `map` to present it in 2 different ways
- follow along through the code to see how they relate.
- Data is loaded when clicking the button
- `fetch` obtains the data from a `.json` file
- that data is loaded from the file and converted into an `Array` of `Object`s
- Lit then sees the `Array` of items change and automatically re-renders the data ðŸ¤¯

## Activity 1 - Adding environmental variables to play along
- We need to add environmental variables in order to make this work. For the purposes of this being easy, I will give you 3 key pair values in discord (if they are made public it'll get the repo potentially shut down hence I can't include them)
- Go to your project on vercel.com and find Settings -> Environment variables
- See the thread I made on Discord for 3 settings to put in place. Make sure you mark them as Production, Staging AND Development
- Save. Now go to a terminal prompt for your fork on your local computer
- type: `vercel pull` and then `vercel dev` from the git repo on your machine
- You should have the weather in Pittsburgh and a few other cities as well as a busteed looking comment thread
- these just loaded from endpoints in vercel!
- Let's say hello. http://localhost:3000/api/hello?name=Bob (you may need to hit CTRL + Shift + R to make it show)
- Look in the `/api` directory to find the associated file `hello.js`
- Now we'll look at the other calls in the "app" to see how they work with the network trace tool
- Understanding what Vercel Magic is happening w/ Lambdas and JSON responses
- Vanilla-ish which is why I have adopted (and what my definition of that is)

## Activity 2
- Starting the spec work of scoping the front end assets
- Take 15 minutes and start doing this with your partner / people around you if they aren't here
  - What can we make an element? How many elements are there? What are their scopes? (Card vs Card list vs icon. things like that)
  - What should it be called?
  - What properties / data need exist and what types?
  - If input could be flexible, what is a good name for the slot. Does it have more than 1 slot?
  - What fake data / what's some example data we could use to power this? We want to print at least 8 items so we have robust example output
  - What should the endpoint be name to be logical? `/api/whatever`
- From this, we will collectively agree upon a contract for each option of the project (as well as see the overlap)

## Homework
- Due to limitations in vercel, you'll have to run vercel builds / wire it up to your personal forks
- A way to side-step this is 1 person hooks Vercel up to their account, everyone else gets writes on their repo and then works within branches or forks off of them
- Have 1 partner start the repo and then you contribute to their repo. Commit logs later prove you both worked on it (dont worry about credit)
- Repo to build off of -- https://github.com/btopro/drew-card
- We're going to build a very simple API from a differnt boilerplate repo to ensure we've got the initial concept down
- I've done a lot of the initial wiring. Take this repo and refactor it to
  - Print an additional card
  - Change the data about the cards to match your data
  - Use your card asset instead of mine
- Blog post check in:
  - Writing the 1st article in a series about the scope of what your going to be building
  - Include images of how you are conceiving the API for the elements involved and the names
  - What properties do you think you'll need
  - What sorta of information will need to come from the backend to make this work?

## Week 10 â€“ 16: Final Projects
- Final projects laid out. Lectures / lessons / code reviews still happen but are more focused on ways of helping pairs complete the project in question.
- Scope / requirements of each project will vary. Students will pick from one of a variety of options
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- Check ins / progression expectations each week
- MobX / State management practice
- Routing
- localStorage
- Peformance enhancements

## Week 17: Final project due Tuesday of Finals week
- Class held for last minute office hours / debugging

# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

## Week 1: Welcome to class
- Tues: Welcome and syllabus day
- https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQFHd8-tdwZWEvParOr5YBKNze_51aXjOKBeAkpUGbE/edit?usp=sharing
- between class: https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/requirements - get accounts on these services
- Thurs: Get basic structure around code, fundamentals and playing with stuff

### Homework
- Create an account on https://github.com 
- Create accounts on the services listed here: https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/requirements
- Create a PUBLIC Gist on https://gist.github.com/  called week-1.md (so that you can write markdown)
- Watch the following video / have it open in another tab: https://youtu.be/DWvRV9KuTjk 
- Write responses using Markdown (Look it up if you don't know how to do it but bottom right corner in gist will have a `M^` button w/ details):
  - If the question is a simple answer / response. Then make it a HEADING using markdown for the question
  - If ther question has multiple responses (like 5 syntaxes) then make the question a HEADING level 2, but the responses using a bulleted list
  - If you end up adding a code sample, use the ` ``` ` three back ticks syntax in order to show the code in a block.
- Questions to answer
  - Was the backend or frontend responsible for the bug in the video?
  - What languages do you see in this video? List them. If you're not sure what the language is, but you know it's different, indicate that.
  - What tools, strategies, and workflows used in the video do you think are common across all web development?
  - What strategies used in the video help with debugging?
  - What tools and approaches used in the video do you think help in quality control / quality assurance?
  - What are 5 syntaxes / pieces of code shown you DO recognize (could be of any scale or size), time stamp (link) or screenshot it and list what they are them. (screen shots can be drag and dropped into the comment area below your gist)
  - What are 5 syntaxes / pieces of code shown you DON'T recognize, time stamp (link) or screenshot it and list what they are them. (screen shots can be drag and dropped into the comment area below your gist)

Submit the link to your GIST using the Canvas HW 1 Dropbox

## Week 2: HTML / CSS fundamentals / Github
- A basic demonstration of Git / Github with an activity to collaboratively author content
- Discussing base line topics around HTML and how the DOM works
- Semantic, responsive design, accessibility, and design topics will be practiced
- Homework watching:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM9KTKQ_4H0

## Week 3: JS Fundamentals
- How JS can access and modify HTML and CSS
- VanillaJS vs jQuery, Event Loop and how JS works
- Let's look at template literals (we'll use them later on)
 - I need to learn about them, so Mozilla docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates
   - https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/ExpNyQx?editors=1111 - let's see how this can be used
     - https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/ZEjBObq?editors=1111 - follow up

## Week 4-5: JS Ecosystem
- Tooling, how people work in industry, different projects (high level)
- Hello world a palooza. Set up a working deployed copy of each, review the code on GitHub. What are the similarities, what are the differences in repo structure? Look at the syntax of a js/template file from each. What is vanilla and what seems to be library specific?

## Week 6-8: Web components (project 1)
- Why web components, understanding how Wcs interplay with other libraries, who’s using them and why
- OpenWC specifically running through the cli and making a new project to collaborate on GitHub. Reading the lit docs
- CSS in ShadowRoot, prop drilling, leveraging existing packages

- **Thursday prior to spring break there is no class**

## Week 9: Spring Break

## Week 10-11: Micro frontends (project 2)
- Publishing to NPM
- Vercel and project publishing and communication
- Creating an API endpoint to return data
- Creating a basic web component to render data from an end point using fetch to obtain information

## Week 12 – 16: Final Project
- Final projects laid out. Lectures / lessons / code reviews still happen but are more focused on ways of helping pairs complete the project in question.
- Scope / requirements of each project will vary. Students will pick from one of a variety of options
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- Check ins / progression expectations each week
- MobX / State management practice

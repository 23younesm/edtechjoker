# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.
- [Resource for reviewing concepts](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5efO_Q5VGZcPE4O_TM_HGP4)
- [Common issues, run through this before talking to me plz](common-issues.md)

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.
- [Week 1](fa-23/week-1/README.md)
- [Week 2](fa-23/week-2/README.md)
- [Week 3](fa-23/week-3/README.md)
- [Week 4](fa-23/week-4/README.md)
- [Week 5](fa-23/week-5/README.md)

# Week 6 - remediation

## Let's get GENERAL BROAD concepts down here of how to develop with open WC here
![How to class / work with these different projects](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/assets/329735/c110a2de-09c9-4a5d-81bf-9d9d07d3a886)

Some of you are getting it, but we've got a lot of ghosts out there right now. There's a few ways to solve this:
- Office hours with TAs, they know what they are doing and can help
- Office hours, ask me about them if needed
- In class time is a lot of open office hours

## Critique of 3 projects
- https://github.com/VivekUppalapu/my-card -- TS / typescript
- https://github.com/christianwasta/my-card
- https://github.com/Seig1xo/owl-card

## Time in class to work through issues
By the end of this week your card should be (examples shown after, you do your actual open wc card)
- In JavaScript, not typescript
- Code On github - https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms-odl -- Code on github, link to public repo
- Build with a URL that you can review a preview using Vercel with an address similar to https://haxcms-odl-five.vercel.app/
- Buttons working using refactored conventions to work in Web components context

## Wed between class
- Watch this video about making a card via open-wc -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTYv_8EPIo

## Rest of class
- Working in your pod, ask teammates for help, review where people are stuck. If no one in your pod can help and you are really stuck, ask TAs / me for help
- Explaining to some one how something works, helps you refine your understanding / check understanding of how it works

# HW for Week 6
- The above working, turned in on a Gist with links to  your code and your built code working (not a vercel.com.... address, the actual card rendered and working)
- Watch the following to help with week 6 and see ideas for week 7:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waYp5pjp75Q
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8K4EyAncg

# Week 7

## Critique
- examples to come:

# Goals for this week's iteration
- Making our component / card reusable via properties, slots
- Buttons refactored to be stemming from the index.html while card is a stand alone component
- Published to NPM https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages
- Reusing code in code (this completes the development life cycle / feedback loop)

## Bringing code together
- Make a new repo (everyone does) with a new project done  via Open-WC
- Call this project `cards-app` because it's an app, with all your cards in it
- Pull in and `npm install` the work you did previously.
- Pulling in and reusing work from others in the Pod. Cards should be able to be built on the same page

## HW turn in to Canvas
- The above working, turned in on a Gist with links to  your code and your built code working (not a vercel.com.... address, the actual card rendered and working)
- Watch the following again if you need help / review from before
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTYv_8EPIo

# Week 8 - Project 1...

# EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON COURSE PROGRESS
~~~~~~

# Project requirements
Project 1 is well established. Based on our progress and class skill I throttle how the projects beyond that go as far as number, scope, and focus.
- Project 1 - coming soon -- Implementing a piece of the Penn State Brand / style as a web component
- Project 2 - coming soon -- HAX problem space
- Project 3 - coming soon -- More advanced HAX problem space

# Week 6
## Tues
- Remediation on card
- NPM publishing of card
- Vercel demo building of card
## Thurs
- Getting multiple cards into the same UI
- Building and deploying to vercel your "app" that has all 4-5 cards in the same environment
- If someone in your pod hasn't been doing their card / has nothing to add to the overall, then that does not impact your grade

# Week 7 Mid-term exam 10%
## Tues
- Anything from slides is fair game
- Anything from readings is fair game
- Anything produced in class or part of class is fair game
- The internet exists; it will also be fair game
- Google also exists, so it will also be fair game (for you)
- AI exists. But good luck with that. See how it works out.
- This will take place during the start of class and is relatively short

## Thursday
- in class working time on finishing up project 1

# Project 1 is due end of this week
- Project 1 is due at the end of this week
- Use this time to catch up / clean up past assignments you may have missed and refine your project 1 submission to maximize points
- This will be graded with more scrutiny than things leading up to it
- The dropbox for this is on Canvas and is ultimately a repo you are turning in

# Week 12/13: Project 3: HAXTheWeb
# Tues
- [TheKodingKrab](https://github.com/TheKodingKrab/flash-card/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - How should the try again button be implemented?
  - Animations/ potenital flips?
  - Reset of all the components?
- [runtimeErrorsMadeEasy](https://github.com/runtimeErrorsMadeEasy/Project3/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - How do we wire our element to Hax?
  - Can we take creative liberties with the design of our event badges that aren't a part of the comp?
- [table-in-the-corner](https://github.com/table-in-the-corner/project-3/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89546413/140660308-9ca3b50d-c107-4a48-8b9c-593fc304012f.jpeg - great mock ups / function / state definitions!
  - animations?
  - dragging from point a to point b
- [IST402-Group-F](https://github.com/IST402-Group-F/proj3-haxtheweb/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32485432/140665102-15c1548c-80b8-4f27-a5b3-d474d2d71f26.png - nice simplification of what's needed to get going
  - Biggest question right now is how we are going to select words individually out of a paragraph.
  - Heard mention of "word nodes" but aren't 100% how they work or how to use them
- [3B4B](https://github.com/3B4B/project-3/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - Execellent break down documenting what's needed. This is a great plan to go off of and nice use of leaving `<slot>` in your picture
  - Are there any conventions that we need to be aware of based on location for the postcard? (ex. local vs. international)
- [ist402groupj](https://github.com/ist402groupj/project-3/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - good initial mocking over the image in question
  - size and dimensions of this card?
  - repsonsiveness> (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [IST402](https://github.com/IST402/pj3/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - So you ARE doing the postcard yes?
  - Nice image mocked up as to what's to be set to different slots and properties.
  - Are we making exact replicates of the post card or just have to have the same elements as the example?
- [IST-402-Group-1](https://github.com/IST-402-Group-1/sorting-question/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - Please include photo of your hand made mock up
  - what would be the best way to go about this to keep our run time fast
  - what would be the best way to go about this to keep our code simple and easy to read
  - What languange will be most vital to build the function
  - How do we get our code to return a value to see if it is correct or not?
  - how to format the card to make it clear to the user what is happening
- [PenStat](https://github.com/PenStat/penguin-project-three/blob/master/TEAMNOTES.MD)
  - Great notes / direction
  - Please resubmit your picture if you have it bc github apparently didn't like it
- [wrap / unwrap conceptual helper methods](https://dev.to/btopro/simple-wrap-unwrap-methods-explained-3k5f)
- textNode vs dom node
- how to use a `map` / Array objects
- Working with `<input>` elements / events
  - `@change`
  - `@click` to test a value against the "correct answer"
- Internationalization - What is it, what's the methodology our team developed, when is it needed, how to implement it?
  - article: https://dev.to/btopro/i18n-manager-web-component-41a2

## Thurs Building
- The thesis in action and your practicing of technique. We're going to work on a series of different elements with a goal of...
  - making elements that enhance online education
  - Is another "build to a comp" but people have different comps
  - Are things that you can chew on via web components and ask questions
  - Make contributions to HAXTheWeb and get core commits on the project if solutions meet needs we have
  - Get a peak into the next class as far as some of these connecting w/ concepts in that space
- Performance tricks / concepts:
  - Reading: How Penn State (my team) ships web components in an "unbundled" manner -- https://dev.to/btopro/part-1-how-penn-state-unbundles-web-components-for-cdn-deployments-20di
- Rest of class time will be to implement the improvements and discussions that spawn off of ways of achieving the task at hand
- Concepts to cover:
  - `.map` / looping over data to visualize an external resource / repeat a list of items rapidly
  - MutationObservers (change in DOM structure below an item)

# Week 14: Thanksgiving
- Nothing but tur-key tags

# Week 15 & 16: Project 4: Final feedback and open code critique
- This time will be scheduled with presentations by teams of the state of their solutions
- Feedback will be given by fellow HAXTheWeb developers
- This feedback is then to be used to finalize code, documentation and other aspects of the final PR

# Week 17: Finals week
- Tuesday of finals week your team's final PR is due along with all documentation of how to use your solution to the issue(s) your team resolved

# In the weeds stuff yet to add
- Mutation Observer
- Event Propagation
- Data flow

## Guest speakers (confirming dates)
- Michael Potter - Red Hat front-end web developer, worked on HAXTheWeb previously, now works on [PatternFly Elements](https://patternflyelements.com/)
- Nikki Massaro Kauffman - HAX UX and a11y lead, my co-worker-in-crime

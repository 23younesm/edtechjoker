# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Week 5 - More with Web components
This week we start into thinking like an HTML spec author. This is deep thought work for sure and we are lucky to be building on abstractions, but let's start the process that they went through to think about the attribute and design considerations of the HTML primative tags (p, img, a, table, etc) and use that process to build our own card so that it is reusable like the original tags but more robust!
## Tues
- Let's review issues people had in doing that
- We have a component, but is it reusable? Can we actually use it outside of the demo we're on right now?

### Activity - 10 minutes
- With your pod, review your cards
- If anyone had issues getting their card to work locally, help.
- AFter that write up the following:
- What about the card COULD be made reusable if we had the ability to use variables?
- What about the data of those things? Are there data types or ways of thinking about that input that help inform the name or how we could structure our properties?
- What about the design could be made variable so people could make it look like their own card? Are there ways of using variables to modify the design?

### Class discussion
- What can be made variable, what did people come up with. What is the "data type" of these variables? Let's agree upon how we want this card to work
- Let's wire properties up to make our asset reusable

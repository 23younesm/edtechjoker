# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 10 - The one where society doesn't shut down completely during spring break
## Tues - The one with the GuEsT LeCtUrE
- EdTechJoker talking about what Project EdTechJoker is and finding your purpose in this world
- All I ask is that you bring paper, something to write with, and an open mind
- I will ask that devices are away, and that you just.. listen, and write things down you find relevant

## Thursday - Unconference
- I love unconferences and feel that I learn WAY MORE at them than a traditional learning experience
- So let's blow up the typical topic

## 20+ minutes
In your pods, review your last blog post and code. Mark someone as the 'scribe' to document the conversation

### Everyone discuss what you struggled with in Stretch 1 (the counter app)

- When someone nailed it, show how you achieved that
- If EVERYONE struggled with something and didn't get it; write down what your pod DID NOT GET AT ALL
- If everyone nailed something, write that down in another column

### Everyone discuss what you struggled with in Stretch 2 (the university status element)

- When someone nailed it, show how you achieved that
- If EVERYONE struggled with something and didn't get it; write down what your pod DID NOT GET AT ALL
- If everyone nailed something, write that down in another column

### Scribes. What did we not understand?
- We'll go a pod at a time. What concepts / things in both stretches did you NOT understand?
- When someone mentions something that they didn't get, if your group wrote down that you 'got it' for that concept, raise your hand / say so.
- We'll write down on the board concepts that need additional coverage
- After this list is generated, we'll form mini-study groups for each concept
- People that feel confident they understood the concept, you are the defactor instructor there
- People that feel lost on a concept, you are the students working with that instructor to better understand the concept

- This will involve getting up and moving. If we have 3 concepts, that's 3 groups. if we have 8 concepts its' 8. this will be highly contextual to the topic space / what is missing

## Homework
- Write a HAX.psu blog post about your experience with this 'unconference' style of learning
- Apply any additional remediations you desire to Stretch 2 based on feedback / points missed as well as the discussions you had
  - You can gain full credit on these for meeting all requirements
- What did you learn that you were unsure of prior to the unconference groups?
- What (if anything) was your take away from the talk "With the right tools, you can build anything"?
- How can you apply this to your life and career?
- What other topics do you wish were covered or questions you have about the web that we can untangle in a similar manner? This does not have to be course material, it could be any web related concept you are unsure of still.
- Turn this in by Sunday night. This concludes the homework portion of the course

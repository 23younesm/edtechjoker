# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.
- [Resource for reviewing concepts](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5efO_Q5VGZcPE4O_TM_HGP4)
- [Common issues, run through this before talking to me plz](common-issues.md)

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.
- [Week 1](fa-23/week-1/README.md)
- [Week 2](fa-23/week-2/README.md)
- [Week 3](fa-23/week-3/README.md)
- [Week 4](fa-23/week-4/README.md)
- [Week 5](fa-23/week-5/README.md)

# Week 6 - remediation
Some of you are getting it, but we've got a lot of ghosts out there right now. There's a few ways to solve this:
- Office hours with TAs, they know what they are doing and can help
- Office hours, ask me about them if needed
- In class time is a lot of open office hours

## Let's get GENERAL BROAD concepts down here of how to develop with open WC here

## What if I don't get how to use something
- Ask
- Ask ChatGPT
- Ask Google

There are dozens of resources, MANY produced by people who took earlier versions of this class, that can help.

# EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON COURSE PROGRESS
~~~~~~

# Project requirements
Project 1 is well established. Based on our progress and class skill I throttle how the projects beyond that go as far as number, scope, and focus.
- Project 1 - coming soon -- Implementing a piece of the Penn State Brand / style as a web component
- Project 2 - coming soon -- HAX problem space
- Project 3 - coming soon -- More advanced HAX problem space

# Week 6
## Tues
- Remediation on card
- NPM publishing of card
- Vercel demo building of card
## Thurs
- Getting multiple cards into the same UI
- Building and deploying to vercel your "app" that has all 4-5 cards in the same environment
- If someone in your pod hasn't been doing their card / has nothing to add to the overall, then that does not impact your grade

# Week 7 Mid-term exam 10%
## Tues
- Anything from slides is fair game
- Anything from readings is fair game
- Anything produced in class or part of class is fair game
- The internet exists; it will also be fair game
- Google also exists, so it will also be fair game (for you)
- AI exists. But good luck with that. See how it works out.
- This will take place during the start of class and is relatively short

## Thursday
- in class working time on finishing up project 1

# Project 1 is due end of this week
- Project 1 is due at the end of this week
- Use this time to catch up / clean up past assignments you may have missed and refine your project 1 submission to maximize points
- This will be graded with more scrutiny than things leading up to it
- The dropbox for this is on Canvas and is ultimately a repo you are turning in

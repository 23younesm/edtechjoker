# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

## Week 10-12: Micro frontends (project 2)
### Overview
- Vercel and project publishing and communication
- Creating an API endpoint to return data
- Creating a basic web component to render data from an end point using fetch to obtain information

## Tues
- Discussing project two and the notion of micro front ends
- Playing with and deploying example from a previous IST class
- Starting the spec work of scoping the front end assets

## In between class
- Watch this video to understand the concept with a different example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgZKpJhQ7os
- We are building the front end to be more robust than this example but the same concepts apply
  - Front end asks for data or user has input
  - `fetch` hits vercel `/api` and processes information
  - response sent back and front end does something with it

## Thurs
- Start looking at my boilerplate repo, fork it and start working on the homework

> EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
# EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
> EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE

## Homework
- We're going to build a very simple API from a boilerplate repo to ensure we've got the initial concept down
- I've done a lot of the initial wiring. Take this repo and refactor it to
  - Print an additional card
  - Change the data about the cards to match your data
  - Use your card asset instead of mine
- Project status check in / pre-flight issues identified / What questions you have


## Week 13 â€“ 16: Final Project
- Final projects laid out. Lectures / lessons / code reviews still happen but are more focused on ways of helping pairs complete the project in question.
- Scope / requirements of each project will vary. Students will pick from one of a variety of options
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- Check ins / progression expectations each week
- MobX / State management practice

# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

## Week 13 - Project 2 Due April 9th; begin scoping Project 3
### High Level how you should be approaching this
- Generally we want dumb components that are design oriented and smart components that bring them to life
- Badge element (visually)
- Badge List element (Array, map'ed and prints Badge element)
- Search element (visually)
- "app" element that listens to events on search (input), does the searching in `/api/search`, and then takes those results and prop drills them into the Badge List element (which then prints them out)
- Logic could happen in your `index.html` but might be easier to manage events in a `badge-app` level element so that top document is just `<badge-app>`

## Tues
- More time to work in class

## Thurs
- Review of Project 3 options. Select the option you want to do for Project 3 by the weekend. Do this by claiming it in the issue queue. max of 10 per project (2 projects may have 11, all must have 10 1st)
- More time to work on project 2

## Homework
- Finished badge app submitted to vercel
- Final blog post wrapping up the project and pointing to your code / running demo for others to enjoy
- How many elements did you end up going with? Why did you break it up that way?
- What was the hardest aspect of this?
- What part of this project was easier than you expected?

## Week 14 â€“ 16: Final Projects
- Final projects laid out. Scope / requirements of each project will vary. Students will pick from one of a variety of options
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/labels/7B
- Check ins / progression expectations each week
- this is 30% of the course so treat it like a real world problem you are solving
- if you crush this, crush the course and enjoy the projects section, this is what independent studies are with me except the whole semester (3 credit 400 level course)

## Week 17: Final project due Tuesday of Finals week
- Class held for last minute office hours / debugging

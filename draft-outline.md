# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 11 - Project 1
You'll then have class time to work with your pod (and beyond it as desired). This is to be worked on in true open source fashion. I want the best solution, and the best solution comes from the most people exploring it as possible. You are expected to produce your own code, your own repo, your own deliverable version, but you are also expected to talk to and work together in and out of class as needed.

The best solution most likely gets adopted into the platform, improving education and reducing the costs to develop software. It also becomes something you can easily put on a resume having contributions to a growing open source project with aspirational goals.

## Today in class
- Answering some questions that came from your blog posts
- Laying out Project 1's context.
- Time to start working on a wire-frame of what you are attempting to build
- Asking questions

# Project 1

- Project 1 https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1950
- We will do multiple un-conference style swaps / discussions in class
- This is the open source way of solving a problem. You are encouraged to collaborate and work together
- Use your same card repo you have each been using. This keeps git commit histories unique and also forces scoping to ensure nothing conflicts visually or with `window`  calls in DOM

## Rubric - 3 week turn around; 24 points (12% of grade)
This project has 2 check ins, and then submission.
As programming and "correct" is some what subjective, so too is the rubric.
The LAs and I will be grading based on the following types of criteria though as we go through the projects.
- Is there a visual to accompany what was made? Does it have a reasonable level of detail as far as the wireframe in question?
- Is it functional? Does it do the things it needs to from a JS logic perspective?
- Is it well written? Are their comments as to what's going on?
- Is it stateful? Can values be changed on the fly and it reacts accordingly?
- Does it have hard coded values or is it 
- Does it look good? Is it responsive? Does it meet the visual requirements?
- Is the mark up / HTML semantic and accessible? Is it simple in structure and easy to read?
- Does it leverage the DDD Design system? Does it have CSS variables left behind for flexibility?
- Does the demo exhibit variations of the implementation?
- Is it a stand alone web component? Is it reusable? Is there anything else that could be done to make it more reusable?

## Thursday
- More time to discuss and ask questions.
- Discussion groups around researching specific questions.

## Sunday homework
- A check in as far as code status check submitted to Canvas
- Obviously a link to the code repo, hopefully with a working prototype as per vercel address
- I want a check list submitted; What do you think your steps to get this done as far as actionable steps / things that need added to complete?
- In this list, an X next to the things you've gotten done
- Include a picture / link to a figma document of the wireframe that you are basing everything on to attempt to produce this project
- This will be different for everyone. This is largely a 'have you thought through this at all' level check in.
- Status check 1 is 4 points.

# TOPICS BELOW THIS LINE STILL IN FLUX SO WORK AHEAD AT YOUR OWN PERRIL

---

## Week 12 - More Project 1 working time and feedback


## Week 13 - Project 1 due Sunday


## Week 14 - 16 - Project 2
- Code hard, Kick butt and chew bubble gum*
  - *We're all out of bubble gum

# Week 17 - Final Destination
- no items, 5 stock, no mr game n watch
- Final project Due Wed of Finals week

# WC Workshop
- Printing multiple items from a web service
- Last year I wrote a stand alone workshop for some non-IST students
- We'll use a variation of this to start to look at how we can get data via `fetch` and `json` structures in order to "stamp" multiple copies of our template

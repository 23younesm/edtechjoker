# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

Project 1 is still being fleshed out, so don't start on it, but here is the issue we will be tackling as a class starting next week: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1950

# TOPICS BELOW THIS LINE STILL IN FLUX SO WORK AHEAD AT YOUR OWN PERRIL

# Week 11 - Project 1
I'll lay out the context and background details about project 1.
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1950

You'll then have class time to work with your pod (and beyond it as desired). This is to be worked on in true open source fashion. I want the best solution, and the best solution comes from the most people exploring it as possible. You are expected to produce your own code, your own repo, your own deliverable version, but you are also expected to talk to and work together in and out of class as needed.

The best solution most likely gets adopted into the platform, improving education and reducing the costs to develop software. It also becomes something you can easily put on a resume having contributions to a growing open source project with aspirational goals.



# WC Workshop
- Printing multiple items from a web service
- Last year I wrote a stand alone workshop for some non-IST students
- We'll use a variation of this to start to look at how we can get data via `fetch` and `json` structures in order to "stamp" multiple copies of our template

# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

## Week 10-12: Micro frontends (project 2)

# Guest lecturer
EdTechJoker

### Overview
- Vercel and project publishing and communication
- Creating an API endpoint to return data
- Creating a basic web component to render data from an end point using fetch to obtain information

## Tues
- Discussing project two and the notion of micro front ends to get there
- [Project 2](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/sp-23/projects/project-2.md)
- Playing with and deploying example from a previous IST class

## Activity to get some base concepts
- EVERYONE. Make a new repo https://github.com/btopro/ist-vercel-demo

## In between class
- Keeping up with industry arguments: https://eisenbergeffect.medium.com/about-web-components-7b2a3ed67a78
- Why people keep writing long artitcles like this is bc of statements like this are rampant https://twitter.com/dannymoerkerke/status/1635387397105139713
- Watch this video to understand the concept with a different example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgZKpJhQ7os
- We are building the front end to be more robust than this example but the same concepts apply
  - Front end asks for data or user has input
  - `fetch` hits vercel `/api` and processes information
  - response sent back and front end does something with it

## Thurs
## Activity 1
- Tracing network calls and how this repo is working
- Understanding what Vercel Magic is happening w/ Lambdas
- Vanilla-ish which is why I have adopted (and what my definition of that is)

## Activity 2
- Starting the spec work of scoping the front end assets

## Homework
- We're going to build a very simple API from a boilerplate repo to ensure we've got the initial concept down (will post Thursday)
- I've done a lot of the initial wiring. Take this repo and refactor it to
  - Print an additional card
  - Change the data about the cards to match your data
  - Use your card asset instead of mine
- Blog post check in:
  - Writing the 1st article in a series about the scope of what your going to be building
  - Include images of how you are conceiving the API for the elements involved and the names
  - What properties do you think you'll need
  - What sorta of information will need to come from the backend to make this work?

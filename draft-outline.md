# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs.

# week 1 - Hello Education, Tooling basics
## Tuesday
- Introduction to class
- 1 of the only days I'll talk the entire time
- Definitely some of my best material from a comedic timing perspective
## Thursday
- What is tooling? what do I need? Why do I need it? What does it do?
- Lab: Getting tooling installed and being able to establish a hello world boilerplate
- Past students of mine: Roam the class helping people get things installed

## Homework / Lab
- Write a blog post about how to get NodeJS, Yarn, NPM, and all the other dependencies installed in order to launch https://open-wc.org/guides/#quickstart
- Screenshots and links to other spaces and videos that helped you learn how to do this
- What NPM is, why developers have landed on this convention, what does it provide you the ability to do on the web?

- Past Students: Install docker and get a copy of HAXcms running locally on your machine https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms
  - Write up how to get docker installed on your machine
  - Use HAXcms as a backdrop (screenshots etc) so that your tutorial involves installing something real
  - Explain what docker is, why you think it's useful
  - Yes. I am very aware that I didn't cover this. Welcome to being the loss-leader on assignments when you've had this topic last semester ;)

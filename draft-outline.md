# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Project 2

> Code hard, Kick butt and chew bubble gum*
> *We're all out of bubble gum

 Project 2 is another issue from the queue, but this time you and your pod get to research it and pick from several options. These are all similar scope and complexity but touch on different aspects of what's available in a larger system context. Read through them in full detail, find the one that's of interest to you and your pod and claim it. I want to see roughly 1/2 the classs doing each issue. This way there's enough variety for you in reviewing solution paths with other pods. Ideally 1/2 the class does each.

## State managment internal to a single element - Tagging question
https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1334

## State management external to a singleton element - Image gallery / presentation method
https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1946

# Requirements of either
- An initial comp; preferrably in Figma / design program of choice to produce an agreed upon image / wireframe. This can be hand drawn as long as it has all details expressed
- Start from a new boilerplate for this project using the Template option like we did many weeks ago -- https://github.com/btopro/polaris-chip
- Weekly check-ins
- Class to get feedback
- Same feedback loop as before; produce work. I'll pick 1 solution from each option and we'll review.
- Even when an option is not your own, walking through the code can help generate ideas about how you could solve a similar problem in your own

## Programs required for use to ensure quality
Both of these are Chrome store, there might be versions for Firefox if you use that browser.
- Light House -- Work on obtaining the highest scores possible; it might not be possible to get 100% but it will give really good feedback about things like accessibility, performance, and structure https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?pli=1
- WAVE - accessibility testing plugin. Gives good feedback on really nitty gritty areas https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh

# Rubric for Project 2 (Final project)
This is a bit more subjective than the previous one because if this was an industry grade project (and it is) then your boss is going to accept solutions that maximize the following aspects:
- How closely does it match the requirements laid out by the client? is anything missing? were there compromises for additional gains?
- Is it well designed? Is it visually pleasing? Is it easy to use and understand what is expected when a user goes to interact with it?
- Is it maintaining a high level of accessibility?
- Is it performant? Are there areas for added efficiency where it could be even faster?
- Is it stateful? Can we modify properties and other HTML after the fact and everything still works as expected?
- Are multiple web components used and work together using events and properties to manage state?
- Is this reusable? Could we drop it into any web site / project and leverage it outright?
- Could this be used in a production environment? Can we go live with this or are there other modifications required to do so?
- Is the code well written, clean, commented, original, and understandable?

Week 14 - 16 will follow this pattern like we've been doing. Class is still required attendence and you are once again encouraged to work together. We'll have additional dedicated segments where you swap work and provide feedback on problems you are having with other pods doing the same project.

# Week 14 - Tuesday
- It's amazing outside. I want you to take your pod and go outside / meet some place not this class and discuss the following:
- Review each issue, thoroughly and answer the following

1. What do you think the hardest aspect of both issues is?
2. What do you think the easiest parts of both issues is?
3. Doodle a wireframe of each.
4. Which of these are you more interested in doing?

- Where ever you are in these discussions, submit to the Teams general channel at 12:50, and then walk back to continue class.
- We will discuss these concerns / project options as a class
- **As the discussion is taking place we'll take attendence.**
- I will ask after this discussion, to confirm with your pod which issue you are going to work on. I would like to have about a 50/50 split for the class but as long as there are 5 pods doing an issue we are good.

# Week 15 - Keep working

## Tuesday
- More time to keep working

## Thursday
Class Discussion:
- Take 10 minutes and discuss what you all have working
- What you are stuck on is especially important. Not nessecarily what you haven't done so much as what you are struggling to get started on.
- Post to Teams what you are stuck on so we can link people up to solve these problems as best we can

## Sunday / check in

- Check in 2 Due Sunday
- There should be code either heavily on the design side or on the logic side
- It should be starting to take shape and if it is not, you should be asking questions or attending office hours to make this happen

# Week 16 - Keep working

## Tues
Class Discussion:
- Mix up so that you are sitting with one person who is working on the same project as you but is NOT in your team
- Go anywhere and discuss issues you are having (this can be in the room, outside if it's nice or the many hall way desks)
- With this partner, discuss what you have working, what you don't have working, what you are stuck on, and help each other with the parts you've nailed
- Take 30 minutes to do this. So back in the room at 12:40
- At the end of this partner exercise. Come back to your pod and discuss what you learned and generate discussion about how you can solve the problems you have remaining
- Should be wrapping up the project, enhancing, finalizing, confirming with other pods

## Thursday
- Open office hours to come in and work and finalize projects
- Can also get feedback about specific things missing or that should be improved to maximize output

# Week 17 - Final Destination
- no items, 5 stock, no mr game n watch

## Tueday of finals week
- No requirement on class; come to class though if you'd like open office hours for last minute questions


# Final project Due **Wed of Finals week**

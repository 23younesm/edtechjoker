# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Exam / Project 1
This is to be submitted to the dropbox in Canvas which shares the same directions:

In class we will do this together, as a group for discussion, walking through step by step. It is then your responsibility to submit this with the following requirements:

- Create a template repo off of this one on github: https://github.com/btopro/polaris-chip
- This repo was built using open-wc but with all the 'correct' settings to make things build rapidly
  - Here's a video of me building it if you care to see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XwCJ_Kgk2Y 
- Wire this up to vercel so that you can get a distribution pipeline of your changes being published
- Remember to change the "Build and Output" settings to say `dist`
- We are going to do the polaris-chip element found on this page:
  - issue: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1738
  - example in context (scroll to bottom in the 'tags' section of this page): https://www.psu.edu/news/academics/story/penn-state-rises-world-university-rankings-places-20th-among-us-publics/
- Video from class live building this -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXibz3KeGL4

You have to meet the requirements of the element visually and turn in the following:
1. A link to your publicly available github repo of YOUR work
2. A link to your project built and working on Vercel with a https:// WHAT-EVERNAME . vercel.app style address

Rubric 10 points total:

- 2 points -
  - polaris-chip element built and looks as close to the comp as possible
  - meets the requirements visually as far as spacing and in your demo it looks like it does on the psu news website when multiple are displayed
- 6 points -
  - stateful, logical property names
  - The element has css flexibility via reflected property to toggle (statefully) between 2 visual states of the tag
  - the element uses slot OR property based versions such that `<polaris-chip label="Cool stuff"></polaris-chip>` AND `<polaris-chip>Cool Stuff</polaris-chip>` both match the design in question
  - Support for a URL
- 2 point - code is built successfully and deployed on vercel with links to your built version + the github code in the repo

**This is due by Sunday.**

# Schedule

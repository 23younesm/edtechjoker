# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 7 - Stretch 2 of 2

## Tues

Common gotchas:
- Make sure your github repo is public
- Create everything locally on your computer 1st
- Make sure you are in the correct folders / organize where the code is under the github desktop folder it desires to be i
- associate it to the github desktop app
- use the app to create the new repo on the fly, probably easiest option
- ensure you have a `.gitignore` file, not everyone's machines copied / produced these, though many did.

### Crit
- Recording of live crit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJcArUPtco
- Live review of a well made examples:
  - https://github.com/tay3434/counter-app
  - https://github.com/DylanConnor28/counter-app
- Mood check; how we feeling about current progression?

## Next Stretch
- https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2147
- Using the HAX tooling, create a new repo and go through the process again. This time for a new element
- This element has a *ton* of detail as far as what to make and some examples of how to go about making it for something this small

## 10 min discussion
- Draw this on paper what it should look like? What does a demo look like?
- Come up with a plan among people in your pod. How are you going to approach this?
- Write out some steps. What are the first 5 steps you think you'll have to take AFTER creating it via the HAX tooling,  install, code on github, etc.
- What is unknown from reading the requirements? What do you have no idea how you'll tackle?
- Take a picture of your plan and post in teams replys for today
- We'll discuss / answer questions
  - Common next steps
  - Common questions

## My Github is having issues
- edit the following file: `.git/config`
- find the address that says `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git`
- change it to say: `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- use desktop to push up

## Working time
(I feel seen)

- We will start in class on this element with the expectation being that you get _as close to done_ as possible by **Thursday**
- We will discuss what has been made in class Thursday among pod and wider group discussions
- There is a 50% bonus oppurtunity on this assignment
- Code you would like live reviewed to improve upon please submit to Teams Wed night for review Thursday in class

## Thursday
- Reviewing current solutions / problems that anyone brings
- Let's get AI to help. I put the directions into a tool called [https://bolt.new]()
- https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb1-xhsigv?file=src%2Fun-sdg.js - I took what bolt made, then cleaned it up to actually work. It has a lot wrong, but many things right. As always with AI, you must know how to read it to accurately use it.
- More time to work and ask questions

## Common questions
- `npm init @haxtheweb` to start the repo
- when this asks you about git, it will default to something like `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git` DO NOT USE THIS FORMAT
- insead change it to `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- If you already did accept the default see the next heading for how to fix it.

## My Github is having issues
- edit the following file: `.git/config`
- find the address that says `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git`
- change it to say: `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- use desktop to push up or the git capability built directly into VSCode.

## Homework
- **Because I am giving you a large chunk here for help, I want every 5 lines there to be a comment as to what that block of code does. You don't need to comment on the large array of objects and I highly recommend you use that piece, however every method should be commented, any time there is an if statement / looping logic, I'd like it commented as to what or why it is doing that**.
- https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2147 fully working solution
- published on vercel
- code on github
- link to whatever.vercel.app address + github code

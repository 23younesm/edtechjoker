## Week 14 â€“ 16: Final Projects
- Final projects laid out. Scope / requirements of each project will vary. Students will pick from one of a variety of options
- [See Project 3 Requirements document](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/sp-23/projects/project-3.md)
- Check ins / progression expectations each week (1% each, simple status check to see what questions you have)
- this is 30% of the course so treat it like a real world problem you are solving
- if you crush this, crush the course and enjoy the projects section, this is what independent studies are with me except the whole semester (3 credit 400 level course)

## Week 17: Final project due Wed of Finals week
- Optional Class held Tuesday of finals week for last minute office hours

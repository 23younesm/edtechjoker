- input vs change event
- https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/XWPxNKj?editors=1111

## Activity - start on project 2
- [Project 2 requirements
](https://github.com/elmsln/edtechjoker/blob/master/sp-23/projects/project-2.md)
- with your partner, create a single repo to contribute to based on open-wc application
- wire this up to vercel
- have them fork it for contribution or work in branches on the same repo (your choice but have to work in 1 repo)
- clone locally (both of you)
- Come up with an intial API for working with your card/collapse
- start dividing labor. one person work on the API connector (badge-list), render results from the "search" endpoint
- One person start on the "badge card" or "requirement collapse" (even # group or odd # group)

**Remember, the point of Project 2 is to generate the exact asset from the comp**

## Wed into Thurs
- Work on your badge asset and search backend
- If you have anything you'd like me to review and offer feedback / direction to the class on Thursday, send me a DM on discord in between w/ a link to the repo and specific things you'd like me to review

## Thurs
- Review of things sent in (briefly)
- More time to work

## HW
- Code status check in
- If you didn't submit your work last week as a blog post, please do so
- 2nd post in the series focused on how you are concieving the API for your element both on the frontend and backend
- Screens of your current progression visually on your element
- Write from the perspective of including answers to these questions:
  - How did you start?
  - What did you decide to attack first?
  - What issues have you had?
  - What concepts translated from Project 1's card?
  - What's your next priority?
  - What problems are you unsure of how to solve?

## Week 12 - Project 2 Critique and feedback
- In class reivew of some in-progress work

## Tues
- More time to work, ask questions, run into problems
- Using async await + Booleans to show loading
- How to test loading in slow environments

## Thurs
- Accesibility considerations
- More time to work

## Homework
- More code check in / progress. By this weekend your app should be wired up, rendering badge / collapses and feel like it's almost working
- Blog post about progression you've made
- How did you get the relationship between Searching and rendering results working
- Draw a diagram on draw.io for user interaction pattern. What happens from user input, through machine sending value, to re-rendering on the page
- Think of a real world use-case from industry (Media streaming, youtube, corporate, cable company provider, web platform, etc) where micro-service architecture could fit into their business context. How could we use this approach to solve a real problem at a company currently using a monolithic design architecture?

## Week 13 - Project 2 Due; begin scoping Project 3

- More time to work in class
## Tues

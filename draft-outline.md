# Week 13
## Tuesday - out sick; free working day

## Thursday
- Review work submitted, providing feedback and critique
- [MutationObservers example code pen](https://codepen.io/dayvidwhy/pen/egdZyY?editors=1111) (hit console button in codepen to see what's happening)
  - Mozilla docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
  - change in DOM structure below an item generates a change record / specialized event
  - Could be used to detect when lightdom children are added or changed in a more flexible manner
  - possible example: drag and drop to reorder children would change node order, would be a mutation
  - Mutations can happen on attributes, nodes (order, adding / removing), children of nodes / whole tree, or textNode changes (characterData)
  - Important to do data clean up for memory / performance reasons
- Group activity: sharing progress and providing feedback to teams developing same element as you
- 1/2 of group move left, 1/2 stay; only within the teams working on the same problem
  - Conference badge people group up with trading card people
  - click the words people group up with sort the words people
- Share your repo w/ another team
- switch laptops or clone and setup their project locally to review code
- Each pair should be looking through code of the other group at the same time
- Create an issue that has 3 recommendations for how they could improve their element overall at a code level (CSS, JS logic, or HTML structure)
- The issue should include any problems that you helped talk through with the other team (like if they are stuck on how to solve something, you showed a possible solution, gave advise, and visa versa)
- Post a link to the issue queue of each project at the end of class. There should be at least 2 issues posted in each queue.
- This is class participation for today
- Come back together with your group and discuss / work on project more

# Week 14: Thanksgiving
- Nothing but tur-key tags

- Performance tricks / concepts:
  - Reading: How Penn State (my team) ships web components in an "unbundled" manner -- https://dev.to/btopro/part-1-how-penn-state-unbundles-web-components-for-cdn-deployments-20di



# Week 15 & 16: Project 4: Final feedback and open code critique
- This time will be scheduled with presentations by teams of the state of their solutions
- Feedback will be given by fellow HAXTheWeb developers
- This feedback is then to be used to finalize code, documentation and other aspects of the final PR

# Week 17: Finals week
- Tuesday of finals week your team's final PR is due along with all documentation of how to use your solution to the issue(s) your team resolved

## Guest speakers (confirming dates)

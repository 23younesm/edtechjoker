# Week 4/5 - Putting concepts into practice to build a NASA image viewer

## Tues
- From reading through it seems most understood the fundamentals of the requests we were making and how to wire up to a wikipedia-query tag
  - Several ran into issues w/ rate limitting, a topic we'll need to build a solution for in the future via API keys
  - the codepen has a magic script in it (we call it that, literally) which references a `build.js` file and loads off a registry. It is not to be included in the code of your element. Copy paste slightly less. ðŸ¤”
  - `fetch` and this feedback loop of small thing + API is the act of building a micro-frontend
- Today I'll be stepping through how the following works to form a basis for what your going to do the next 2 weeks: https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project/blob/master/src/CourseDates.js
  - Fun hidden gem for later: The gh pages site for https://github.com/elmsln/ip-project automatically builds with this demo :)
  - We'll touch on this in a future week (but yours are all wired up to auto-build too if built correctly... ðŸ‘ˆ)
- I'm going to take a data model that someone in class produced (`response.json`) and wire it up to a `date-card` webcomponent that an IST student made for us at a previous point in time - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lrnwebcomponents/date-card
  - `@lrnwebcomponents/date-card` is available on NPM if you'd like to follow along
- For this exercise, we're going to take a single response from an API, parse it into an Array, *transform the data into something easier to understand* for our element, and then "stamp" the data down using a specialized `for` loop called a `.map`
  - `.map` allows you to walk `Array` data and can be read as "Take each item in this array and do the following thing with each value"
  - `LitElement` has specialized support for `.map` and `properties` that are `type: Array` to automatically update your element when values change, as a loop

- I'll walk through how I wired an existing date-card element up to the data in question:
  - I'll demonstrate how stateful variables can be leveraged in order to trigger functionality in a `LitElement` based element
  - I'll demonstrate wiring up to form input to modify how many results are rendered

## Resources:
  - Read "Rendering Arrays" in the Lit docs - https://lit.dev/docs/templates/lists/#rendering-arrays (stick with the `.map` convention expressed)
  - Another quick one from open-wc (another great resource) - https://open-wc.org/guides/knowledge/lit-element/rendering/
  - Example from playground (check the JS box though) - https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/repeating-and-conditional
  - Lit Conditional rendering: https://lit.dev/docs/templates/conditionals/
  - Mozilla docs are your JS friend - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getMonth

## Lab this week (started today, worked on Thurs / due Sunday):
I want you to leverage an existing asset our team made called `accent-card` in order to render media from space....
> it's not as ridiculous as that just sounded
- Example response / thing to play with -- https://hax.psu.edu Media search
- This week this is a partner project. So pair program with someone, expect to meet up either this weekend or between classes
- In your repo create a new file that will house your new web component and name this element `nasa-image-search` (file name can be anything you want . js)
- This web component should include `lit` as well as the `accent-card` our team built
  - Docs in a "storybook" to play with: https://webcomponents.psu.edu/styleguide/?path=/story/layout-card--accent-card-story
  - You'll see `slot="` as an attribute on here, this allows rendering content into a specific place on the card. Background reading - https://lit.dev/docs/components/shadow-dom/
  - The npm asset is `@lrnwebcomponents/accent-card` install it (from articles I saw many of you missed adding `--save` which is important for version control
- NASA image API docs - https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf
- example usage to show all images related to the moon landing: https://images-api.nasa.gov/search?q=moon%20landing&media_type=image

## Requirements of your element:
- Named `nasa-image-search`
- Leverages `accent-card` and a `.map` to render the following data onto the card inside your element:
  - The image (`image-src=`)
  - the title (`<div slot="heading">`)
  - the description (`<div slot="content">`)
  - Who took the photo (`secondary_creator`, also included with the content area of the card)
- `fetch` data from the NASA image API based on a method being called to request the data (clicking the search button should initiate this)
- Simplify the response data to an object that only has the data needed for rendering
- using a `.map` render this data
- `index.html` / demo page needs to have this capability:
 - A button that initiates the search when `click`'ed and returns results (defaulting to moon landing)
 - **Option 1**: A "search" `input` that accepts text and changes what's searched for by modifying a property called `term` on your element
 - **Option 2**: A "page number" `input` that accepts a number and changes a property called `page` on your element to request a specific page of results
 - **Option 3**: A "Return data only" checkbox that modified a `Boolean` on your element to conditionally render an unordered `ul` list of items (like my date example) but defaults to the `accent-card` by default.

## Note:
- I have removed all the other boilerplate from my current demo for reference; this is not required but made it easier to read in my example
- This is a multi-week project where all **pairs**, pair program in order to generate the 3 options.
- Start working on this now and ask questions so that we can all learn together toward the solution

## Wed
- Get some initial work done on the nasa-image-search so that you can ask questions.
- Post issues / questions into our slack channel **#edtechjoker** so others can see said questions (there are no stupid questions)
- There are office hours w/ our LA today

## Thursday
- Class time is working time and I'll review questions at the start of class if I haven't responded in the channel already
- I will be available to explain code snippets or offer debugging support

## Due Sunday
- **Each pair should submit a link to 1 repo with their best attempt at solving the lab**
- I'll review solutions for notable answers and aspects that are more "correct" than others / on the right track
- I'll provide feedback via slack and in person next week
- This is the 1st part of a 2 part lab
- The 2nd part will be to finish the lab as a group and merging specific aspects of code together, most likely through a shared coding experience with someone driving and others researching / experimenting to find solutions to each of the 3 options
- Lab 4 is due Sunday at midnight. Each pair / Option should submit their solution as work in progress to the **#edtechjoker** channel. This is a "check in" worth 2 points.

### Note
- Lab 5 is taking all 3 options and merging them together into a solution everyone believes to be the best work the group can assemble.
- Lab 5 is worth 6% and has stupid prizes associated with the best / most correct solution(s)

## Week 5 - Refinement and feedback
Ultimately, we'll work toward each group producing 1 solution.

## Tuesday
- I'll provide feedback on a variety of solutions
- In class activity: Working with your group, review each other's solutions (there are 2 or 3 pairs in each group so review the code of another pair than your partner and visa versa)
- (attendence) Comment on 3 aspects of the pair you reviewed's code. Either offering suggestions, google results for resolving an issue they stated having, or 
- You'll work with your group to produce 1 solution
- Additional requirement:
  - Add support for year_start and year_end in your input form
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local could be used for snagging a date, however the API is just a year so you'd have to transform this info (a `<input>` field that's numbers only is probably fine)

## Thursday
- Additional feedback on any solutions which 
- Additional time to work in class

## Sunday / submitting the Lab
- 1 Solution per team is to be submitted to Canvas for the Lab 5 Dropbox
- This is worth 6%
- Rubric:
  - Queries NASA and returns results as expected, rendered through the `accent-card` tag
  - Options 1,2,3 integrated and can modify the search results 4%
  - Best solution (subjective) +1%

## Week 6 - Static site generator revolution and understanding "build routines" / CI/CD workflows
## Tuesday
- Building web sites and deploying them has never been easier
- We'll look at some static site generators (11ty, HAX11ty) and understand how they structure and use data
- This will help give you insight into both CI/CD code pipelines as well as a lightweight publishing engine

## Thursday
- You'll deploy an 11ty or HAX11ty site.
- This site will be used to help maintain documentation about your microservice
- It's also a window into automated workflows

## Homework / Lab
- Do a Dev.to post on getting started with 11ty or HAX11ty. Use your site you made as a back drop for screen shots and more in the article.
- What are the pros and cons of database driven vs static site / file system driven architectures?

## Week 7 - OpenAPI spec
## Tuesday
- OpenAPI 3.0, what it is, how to use it, examples, how to develop a robust API. Point to the API evangelist
- We'll look at how HAXcms uses "doc blocks" of comments in order to automatically generate Open API spec documents
- https://stoplight.io/
- https://www.postman.com/
## Thursday
- We'll start doing some prototyping in class on paper / tablet
- The goal of this initial rough work is to have...
  - the front end team envision what it might look like
  - the back end team envision what calls their might be to power data of the frontend prototype
  - the API team to refine and envision what the call structure for the API looks like

## Homework / Lab
- What is OpenAPI. Who uses it? who developed it? What affordance does it provide? Why is it important? What is API first architecture? How do we version APIs?

## Week 8 - Docker / Deploying an Express App
## Tuesday
- What is it? Who uses it (everyone... or something similar)? Why we need it?
- We'll spin up several apps on play with docker
## Thursday
- We'll deploy a news App using "Play with Docker"
## Homework / Lab
- Running throught the News App lab in class, do the same thing to make a tutorial / screen cast on how to deploy HAXcms to play with docker

## Week 9 - Cruising on a boat or however you let loose
- 2019 edition, not 2020 edition ðŸ˜¬
- In 2020 when I wrote this on a slide I made a joke about "if you don't all get sick over break and they let us come back here, we'll be working on...."
  - Someone must have not realized it was a joke.

## Week 10 - 15 - Final project
## Week 10 - Vercel / who needs express just know it's there via magic ðŸª„
- We'll use Vercel to deploy final projects (and learn about it as we go)
- Classes these weeks will involve lots of group time
- You'll get time to work in class with the expectation that code is submitted with each weekly check in
- I'll then review anything submitted and use it as a basis for discussion in class
- Each team will have a slightly different project and stack for solving potentially
- They'll all be written in JavaScript (unless your super bold) and have an OpenAPI backend so we'll have lots we can learn from each other
- There will also be peer review / critiques during these times
- Homeworks will be a check in / milestone marker expected to be hit and a status update turned in
- Check ins will account for 10% of the course and doing them will keep you and your group on pace to finish the project on time while meeting all requirements

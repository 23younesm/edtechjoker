# Week 12/13: Project 3: HAXTheWeb
# Tues
- Reviewing scoping questions for projects
- [wrap / unwrap conceptual helper methods](https://dev.to/btopro/simple-wrap-unwrap-methods-explained-3k5f)
- textNode vs dom node
- how to use a `map` / Array objects
- Working with `<input>` elements / events
  - `@change`
  - `@click` to test a value against the "correct answer"
- Internationalization - What is it, what's the methodology our team developed, when is it needed, how to implement it?
  - article: https://dev.to/btopro/i18n-manager-web-component-41a2

## Thurs Building
- The thesis in action and your practicing of technique. We're going to work on a series of different elements with a goal of...
  - making elements that enhance online education
  - Is another "build to a comp" but people have different comps
  - Are things that you can chew on via web components and ask questions
  - Make contributions to HAXTheWeb and get core commits on the project if solutions meet needs we have
  - Get a peak into the next class as far as some of these connecting w/ concepts in that space
- Performance tricks / concepts:
  - Reading: How Penn State (my team) ships web components in an "unbundled" manner -- https://dev.to/btopro/part-1-how-penn-state-unbundles-web-components-for-cdn-deployments-20di
- Rest of class time will be to implement the improvements and discussions that spawn off of ways of achieving the task at hand
- Concepts to cover:
  - `.map` / looping over data to visualize an external resource / repeat a list of items rapidly
  - MutationObservers (change in DOM structure below an item)

# Week 14: Thanksgiving
- Nothing but tur-key tags

# Week 15 & 16: Project 4: Final feedback and open code critique
- This time will be scheduled with presentations by teams of the state of their solutions
- Feedback will be given by fellow HAXTheWeb developers
- This feedback is then to be used to finalize code, documentation and other aspects of the final PR

# Week 17: Finals week
- Tuesday of finals week your team's final PR is due along with all documentation of how to use your solution to the issue(s) your team resolved

# In the weeds stuff yet to add
- Mutation Observer
- Event Propagation
- Data flow

## Guest speakers (confirming dates)
- Michael Potter - Red Hat front-end web developer, worked on HAXTheWeb previously, now works on [PatternFly Elements](https://patternflyelements.com/)
- Nikki Massaro Kauffman - HAX UX and a11y lead, my co-worker-in-crime

# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 13
## Tues
- There are two projects. You must select a project and state which project you are doing by end of class Tuesday. Read and explore the requirements of each. They are different projects but have similar scopes. One is far more state management heavy as well as very detail oriented in # of requirements. The other is a mix of state management, design, and data structure building on the previous project as far as scope.
- [\[project-2a\] Character Creator / rpg-me promotional tool](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/1414)
- [\[project-2b\] Use-cases dashboard comp](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2182)
- After making your selection, put in the comments for the issue that you're going to work on the one in question and post a link to the boilerplate hax CLI made repo as your starting point.

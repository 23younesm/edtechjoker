# Draft outline
This is a draft of the course. The topics we'll cover and the order. It will be established and modified based on student needs and how things are going / what people ask for as far as needing things that match the trajectory we're on.

# Schedule
This schedule will be modified as we go. Look to it for what we are doing in clas that day / week. This becomes more refined as we get closer to the dates. I modulate based on needing to remediate on concepts of adding concepts based on how far we get that week.

# Common issues
Before saying "it doesn't work" with web development in general, please consult this [common issues document](common-issues.md). It is the solution to 95% of the problems I've seen young web devs have when working with web components, terminal, VS code and javascript/html/css more broadly.

# Week 10 - The one where society doesn't shut down completely during spring break
## Tues - The one with the GuEsT LeCtUrE
- EdTechJoker talking about what Project EdTechJoker is and finding your purpose in this world
- All I ask is that you bring paper, something to write with, and an open mind
- I will ask that devices are away, and that you just.. listen, and write things down you find relevant

These questions are things I want you to think about while you listen / take notes:
- What (if anything) was your take away from the talk "With the right tools, you can build anything"?
- How can you apply this to your life and career?

## Thursday - Unconference
- I love unconferences and feel that I learn WAY MORE at them than a traditional learning experience
- So let's blow up the typical topic

## 20+ minutes
In your pods, review your last blog post and code. Mark someone as the 'scribe' to document the conversation

### Everyone discuss what you struggled with in Stretch 1 (the counter app)

- When someone nailed it, show how you achieved that
- If EVERYONE struggled with something and didn't get it; write down what your pod DID NOT GET AT ALL
- If everyone nailed something, write that down in another column

### Everyone discuss what you struggled with in Stretch 2 (the university status element)

- When someone nailed it, show how you achieved that
- If EVERYONE struggled with something and didn't get it; write down what your pod DID NOT GET AT ALL
- If everyone nailed something, write that down in another column

### Scribes. What did we not understand?
- We'll go a pod at a time. What concepts / things in both stretches did you NOT understand?
- If there's other related concepts to what we're doing, let's say it's "I don't understand the difference between let, const, var" then we'll address those sorts of things as we go
- Nothing is out of bound as far as aspects of doing these stretches that you didn't understand. The point of the unconference format is to resolve gaps in knowledge. We grow when we question.
- When someone mentions something that they didn't get, if your group wrote down that you 'got it' for that concept, raise your hand / say so.
- We'll write down on the board concepts that need additional coverage and require a break out group to resolve
- After this list is generated, we'll form mini-study groups for each concept
- People that feel confident they understood the concept, you are the defacto instructor there. LA's and I will also join discussion groups to help ensure content is accurate.
- People that feel lost on a concept, you are the students working with that instructor to better understand the concept

- This will involve getting up and moving. If we have 3 concepts, that's 3 groups. if we have 8 concepts its' 8. this will be highly contextual to the topic space / what is missing
- This will go on for about 20 minutes or so so that people have time to fix and implement what they didn't get
- If you lead a group as the 'teacher' you get a cup.

## Homework
- Write a HAX.psu blog post about your experience with this 'unconference' style of learning
- Apply any additional remediations you desire to Stretch 2 based on feedback / points missed as well as the discussions you had
  - You can gain full credit on these for meeting all requirements
- What did you learn that you were unsure of prior to the unconference groups? If you lead a group, how did teaching refine or change what you thought you knew?
- What (if anything) was your take away from the talk "With the right tools, you can build anything"?
- How can you apply this to your life and career?
- What other topics do you wish were covered or questions you have about the web, career, life, anything you need to grow but can't find the answers to?
- Turn this in by Sunday night. This concludes the homework portion of the course. Things from here are now status check oriented around the project.

Project 1 is still being fleshed out, so don't start on it, but here is the issue we will be tackling as a class starting next week: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1950

# TOPICS BELOW THIS LINE STILL IN FLUX SO WORK AHEAD AT YOUR OWN PERRIL

# Week 11 - Project 1
I'll lay out the context and background details about project 1.
- https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/1950

You'll then have class time to work with your pod (and beyond it as desired). This is to be worked on in true open source fashion. I want the best solution, and the best solution comes from the most people exploring it as possible. You are expected to produce your own code, your own repo, your own deliverable version, but you are also expected to talk to and work together in and out of class as needed.

The best solution most likely gets adopted into the platform, improving education and reducing the costs to develop software. It also becomes something you can easily put on a resume having contributions to a growing open source project with aspirational goals.



# WC Workshop
- Printing multiple items from a web service
- Last year I wrote a stand alone workshop for some non-IST students
- We'll use a variation of this to start to look at how we can get data via `fetch` and `json` structures in order to "stamp" multiple copies of our template


# Week 11-16 - Project 1 and 2 work
- Code hard, Kick butt and chew bubble gum*
  - *We're all out of bubble gum

# Week 17 - Final Destination
- no items, 5 stock, no mr game n watch
- Final project Due Wed of Finals week
